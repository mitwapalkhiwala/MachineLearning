This project is based on classifying the images from the street house numbers. It classifies the numbers from the images into classes 1,2,3..,10

The major tasks involved in Digit Recognition are:
1.Data Preprocessing: Loading training and test dataset, splitting the training data into training and validation data, conversion of RGB to grayscale, normalizing the data and encoding them to make it suitable for the CNN model. It can be found in preprocessing.ipynb

2.Classification of the data: Defining the model, predicting and optimizing the model, training the model, calculating accuracy and plotting the images. It can be found in CNN_model.ipynb
